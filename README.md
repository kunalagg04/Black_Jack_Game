# Black Jack Game

In this project I have created a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.


DETAILS:

The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
The player can stand or hit.
The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
Keep track of the player's total money.
Alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...
